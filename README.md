Transactional stream processing engines (TSPEs) gain traction recently, bringing transaction processing capability to real-time stream processing applications.
However, However, guaranteeing fault tolerance without sacrificing low latency and high throughput is still an open challenge for TSPEs.
This project aims to adapt conventional fault tolerance mechanisms for TSPEs can conduct an extensive experimental evaluation using a well-designed benchmark.
